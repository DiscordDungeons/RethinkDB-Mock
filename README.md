An in-memory RethinkDB used for testing.

The end goal is to replicate the API of [rethinkdbdash](https://github.com/neumino/rethinkdbdash).<br/>
For all intents and purposes, you should get the same results.

Visit the [Github repository](https://github.com/aleclarson/rethinkdb-mock) for more information.
