# rethinkdb-mock v0.0.1

An in-memory RethinkDB used for testing.

The goal is to be an exact replication of native RethinkDB.

Not all methods are implemented. Someday, I will list what's missing.

If you find a method not behaving as expected, please open an issue!

**Feel free to contribute! :)**
